# Question 72: Check Number Range

Implement a function that checks if a number falls within a specified range (inclusive). Return true if the number is within the range, false otherwise.

Examples:

```
Input: num = 15, min = 10, max = 20
Output: true
Explanation: 15 is between 10 and 20 (inclusive)

Input: num = 5, min = 10, max = 20
Output: false
Explanation: 5 is less than the minimum value 10
```

Hints:

1. Use conditional statements to check the number against the range boundaries
2. Remember that an inclusive range includes the boundary values
3. Consider edge cases where the number is exactly equal to min or max
4. Make sure your solution works with negative numbers
