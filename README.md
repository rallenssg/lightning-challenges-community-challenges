# Lightning Challenges Community Repository

Welcome to the Lightning Challenges Community Repository! This is where community members can contribute coding challenges to the Lightning Challenges application - a Salesforce development practice website.

## üöÄ About Lightning Challenges

Lightning Challenges is a platform designed to help Salesforce developers practice and improve their Apex coding skills through hands-on challenges. This community repository allows developers to contribute their own challenges and share knowledge with the broader Salesforce community.

## üéØ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Salesforce CLI installed
- Git installed
- Basic knowledge of Apex and Salesforce development
- A GitHub account

### Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lightning-challenges-community-challenges.git
    cd lightning-challenges-community-challenges
    ```
3. Create your contributor profile (see [Contributor Profiles](#contributor-profiles))
4. Create your first challenge (see [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute))

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Step 1: Create Your Contributor Profile

Before creating challenges, set up your contributor profile:

1. Navigate to `contributors/` directory
2. Create a folder with your GitHub username (e.g., `contributors/your-github-username/`)
3. Create a `profile.json` file with your information (see template in `contributors/_template/`)

### Step 2: Create a Challenge

1. Navigate to `force-app/main/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/`
2. Create a new folder for your challenge: `CHALLENGE_NUMBER-challenge-name/`
3. Use the challenge template from `templates/challenge-template/`
4. Include all required files (see [Challenge Structure](#challenge-structure))

### Step 3: Test Your Challenge

1. Test your template (should compile but fail tests)
2. Test your solution (should pass all tests)
3. Use the command: `cat your-file.apex | sfdx force:apex:execute`

### Step 4: Submit Your Contribution

1. Create a pull request with your changes
2. Include a description of your challenge
3. Wait for review and feedback

## üìÅ Challenge Structure

Each challenge must include the following files:

```
force-app/main/YOUR_USERNAME/CHALLENGE_NUMBER-challenge-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ challenge-name.md              # Challenge description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameTemplate.cls      # Template with TODO implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameTemplate.cls-meta.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameSolution.cls      # Complete solution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameSolution.cls-meta.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameTest.cls          # Comprehensive test suite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ChallengeNameTest.cls-meta.xml
```

### Challenge Markdown Format

Your `challenge-name.md` should include:

- Challenge title and number
- Problem description
- Input/output examples
- Hints (optional)
- Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Author information
- Tags/categories

### Code Requirements

- **Template**: Should compile but return `null` or placeholder values
- **Solution**: Should implement the complete, working solution
- **Tests**: Should use the standard testing framework with comprehensive test cases
- **Documentation**: Include clear JavaDoc comments

## üë§ Contributor Profiles

## üß™ Testing Your Challenges

### Testing Framework

All challenges must use the standard testing framework. Example:

```apex
// Test execution framework
public static Result result = new Result();
public class ResultException extends Exception {}

public class Result {
    public Boolean pass = true;
    public List<TestResult> testResults = new List<TestResult>();

    public void addTestResult(TestResult testResult) {
        this.testResults.add(testResult);
        if (!testResult.pass) {
            this.pass = false;
        }
    }
}

// ... rest of framework code
```

### Running Tests

Test your template (should fail):

```bash
cat YourChallengeTemplate.cls | sfdx force:apex:execute
```

Test your solution (should pass):

```bash
cat YourChallengeSolution.cls | sfdx force:apex:execute
```
